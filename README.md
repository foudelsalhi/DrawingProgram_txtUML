### How to install/run the model
Install the [txtUML](http://txtuml.inf.elte.hu/) in your Eclipse (currently only [Mars](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Mars/2) version is supported) and download
the zip of this project or do

`git clone https://github.com/foudelsalhi/DrawingProgram_txtUML.git`

Go to Eclipse and do the following:
